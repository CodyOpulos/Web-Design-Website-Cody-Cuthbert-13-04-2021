	<h3 style="font-size: 50px; margin-top: 600px;">About Junji Ito</h3>
	
	<p style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 200px;">Acclaimed manga artist Junji Ito has carved out a place for himself in the hearts of horror fans both at home and abroad, based not only on the merits of his manga but also because his works, such as "Uzumaki" and "Tomie," have inspired live-action films and anime (Junji Ito Collection) and have been translated into English as well as other languages.</p>
	
	<h3>The roots of horror: childhood experiences</h3>
	
	<p>Ben K: Since when have you been interested in horror as a genre?</p>
	
	<p>Junji Ito (Ito): When I was very small, maybe 4 or 5 years old, my two older sisters would read Kazuo Umezu and Shinichi Koga in magazines and I read them too. That was my first experience. I was hooked. I began reading horror manga after that.</p>
	
	<p>Ben K: Did you also watch horror movies?</p>
	
	<p>Ito: Yes, when I was very young, I watched Dracula or Frankenstein when they showed it on TV. I lived in the countryside where there were no movie theaters nearby, so I could only see movies on TV. In the 70s, when the occult boom began, I saw The Exorcist on TV as well. So, I watched many occult films, like Dario Argento's Suspiria, for example.</p>
	
	<p>Ben K: So, when did you begin drawing manga?</p>
	
	<p>Ito: I was about 4 or 5 when I began reading, and very soon afterwards, I wanted to try it for myself. I took a pencil and paper, or sometimes the back of advertisements, and would draw frames, imitating the manga I had read. So, I started before I even entered elementary school. It was just for fun, of course. That was how I began.</p>

	<p>Nobushi: I was wondering about something. You say you began reading horror manga at 4 or 5. Kids that age scare very easily. But you were fine with it?</p>
	
	<p>Ito: Yes. The manga I was reading wasn't that scary. On the other hand, TV shows where they went into haunted houses or had a medium who could summon spirits, I thought those were scary. Interesting, but scary. I couldn't go to the bathroom by myself. Especially since the bathroom in my house was at the end of an underground tunnel. When they showed photos with ghostly apparitions on those shows, that was scary. I was scared by things that seemed real to me. As for manga, of course, some of it was scary but for the most part, I found it interesting and intriguing. I loved Kazuo Umezu's drawings. Strange creatures, the grotesque. They fascinated me, so I enjoyed reading his manga. But that bathroom was scary...</p>
	
	<p>Ben K: And if you had to go underground, there must have been insects, like centipedes and the like?</p>
	
	<p>Ito: That's right. In my house, when you went down into the tunnel, we had a storage shed there with an earthen floor. Today, the foundation would be concrete but, in those days, it was exposed earth. And spider crickets would often be there. They look like crickets. We used to call them toilet crickets because they often showed up in those countryside toilets. They have spotted bodies, rounded backs and very long legs, with which they would jump all over the place as soon as you got near them. They really frightened me.</p>
	
	<p>Ben K: I can imagine. So, such experiences were later reflected in your manga.</p>
	
	<p>Ito: They were indeed.</p>
	
	<p>Nobushi: Would you say that most of your works are based on experiences you had and information you learned in your childhood?</p>
	
	<p>Ito: Yes. For example, "The Hanging Balloons" was based on a childhood dream.</p>
	
	<p>Nobushi: That dream must have really left an impression on you...</p>
	
	<p>Ito: Yes. The impressions you have as a child are very strong and stay with you for the rest of your life.</p>
	
	<p>Ben K: Was there a specific experience you had with balloons?</p>
	
	<p>Ito: I lived in the countryside, but I occasionally went into town. I would see ad balloons floating above the buildings, and they were symbols of life in the big city which I aspired to. Also, I liked flying saucers as a kid, UFOs. Strange, unidentified, mysterious objects in the sky. So, I combined elements which I liked and incorporated them into my work.</p>
